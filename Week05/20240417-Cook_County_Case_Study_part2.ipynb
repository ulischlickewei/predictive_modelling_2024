    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 1 of the case study, you performed some basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), laying out the thought process that leads to certain modeling decisions. Then, you added a few new features to the dataset and cleaned the data in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second part, you will specify and fit a linear model to a few features of the housing data to predict house prices. Next, we will analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance. Finally, we'll delve deeper into the implications of predictive modeling within the Cook County Assessor's Office (CCAO) case study, especially because statistical modeling is how the CCAO valuates properties. Given the history of racial discrimination in housing policy and property taxation in Cook County, consider the impacts of your modeling results as you work through this project, and think about what fairness might mean to property owners in Cook County.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this part of the project, you should be comfortable with:\n",
    "- Implementing a data processing pipeline using `pandas`.\n",
    "- Using `statsmodels` to build and fit linear models."
